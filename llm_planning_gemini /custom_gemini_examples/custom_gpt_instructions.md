## Custom Instructions for Gemini Planning

These instructions provide context to Gemini so it can generate usable action sequences for the robot:

- "Pick up the red object and place it into the left bin."
- "Check the object weight. If too heavy, abort."
- "Grip softly if the item is a fragile object."
